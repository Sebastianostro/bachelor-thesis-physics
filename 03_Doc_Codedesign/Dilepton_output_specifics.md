Dileptons.oscar file format has the following logic:
- Per number of Events in a simulation (starting at 0), dileptons can be "produced" e.g. via decay processes or not
    - if no dileptons are produced in an event, the output contains a line like `event 3 ensemble 0 end 0 impact 0.000 scattering_projectile_target yes`, meaning that in the 4th collision event of this simulation nothing happened
    - if dileptons are produced in an event, they can be produced at multiple times during the total event time, each production time is a separated data bloc with a header containing information like `# interaction in 1 out 3 rho 0.0000000 weight 3.940716e-07 partial 0.0000049 type 5`, where weight needs to be extracted for the next 4 lines first explaining the incoming particle (in 1) and then the three outgoing (decay) particles (out 3)
- "weight" needs to be extracted from the bloc header and e.g. later provided to the histogram function in order to weigh the production yield since in reality one dilepton (e⁺e⁻) would only be produced in (1/weight) collisions of this event
- Overall the weighted numbers per bloc need to be divided by the number of events to account for number of events in this simulation and the fact that e.g. some collisions did not produce dileptons at all (see first point above)
